I promise I’ll write about something interesting as soon as I find it, but I have to say this first.
I had the chance to have a better life, and I blew it all away just because I didn’t feel like reading.
It was the stupidest thing I ever did, and it will affect me for the rest of my life.
Another thing—I feel like I’m a disappointing friend. I constantly feel like I’m letting my best friend down. I can’t really explain it more than that.

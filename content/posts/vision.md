Vision

I am not exactly sure what i am thinking about and to be honest whatever it is, it’s probably made before i just know one essential part is an open source MCP server generator then i think I need to wrap the MCP generator in an MCP server then teach Claude to search for APIs and generate MCP servers and host and blah blah blah. Am i going to use an obscure language??? mabey

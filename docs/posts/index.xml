I call them tasteless not because their interests are bad (Clairo is actually good) but because they didn’t earn their interests; they are just copying what they see online consciously or subconsciously. I personally think this is just the response of some people to the red pill movement — it’s just the other side of the same coin.</description></item></channel></rss>

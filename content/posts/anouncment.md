I am pregnant!!!!! Joking I just wanted to talk about my Twitter account I wanted to say that this blog is not going to replace my Twitter account I actually don't like to post here it feels like I'm talking to myself, even though I am actually talking to myself, even in my Twitter account the target audience is me, it's like creating a movie or game for yourself but also inviting others to watch or play it. Everything was fine until I started to get obsessed with meaningless numbers on my screen, likes, followers, views. I became an attention whore, I chased likes and tried to be "right". Anyway, I won't post any more personal content here, I will keep it solely technical.

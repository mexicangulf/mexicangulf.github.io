Joking I just wanted to talk about my Twitter account I wanted to say that this blog is not going to replace my Twitter account I actually don&rsquo;t like to post here it feels like I&rsquo;m talking to myself, even though I am actually talking to myself, even in my Twitter account the target audience is me, it&rsquo;s like creating a movie or game for yourself but also inviting others to watch or play it. Everything was fine until I started to get obsessed with meaningless numbers on my screen, likes, followers, views. I became an attention whore, I chased likes and tried to be &ldquo;right&rdquo;. Anyway, I won&rsquo;t post any more personal content here, I will keep it solely technical.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><div class=post-footer-data><div class=tags></div><hr><div class=date>Published: 2024-11-26</div><div class=updated>Updated: 2024-11-26</div></div></footer></article><footer><div class=social-links-footer><a href=mailto:myemail><div class=social-link>Email</div></a><a href=https://github.com/github%20id target=_blank><div class=social-link>GitHub</div></a><a href=https://gitlab.com/gitlab%20id target=_blank><div class=social-link>GitLab</div></a><a href=https://twitter.com/twitter%20id target=_blank><div class=social-link>Twitter</div></a><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/linkedin%20id target=_blank><div class=social-link>LinkedIn</div></a><a rel=me href=https://example.com/@username target=_blank><div class=social-link>Mastodon</div></a><div class=social-link></div></div><div class=copyright>Copyright (c) 2017, all rights reserved.</div><div class=poweredby>Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.</div></footer></div></body></html>

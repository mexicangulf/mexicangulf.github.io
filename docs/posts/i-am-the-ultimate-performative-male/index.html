I call them tasteless not because their interests are bad (Clairo is actually good) but because they didn’t earn their interests; they are just copying what they see online consciously or subconsciously.
I personally think this is just the response of some people to the red pill movement — it’s just the other side of the same coin. It’s about women, it’s for the female gaze. the only reason that it’s better than red pill is that it’s less rapey, but it’s still not authentic.</p><p>Now, I have to say this: not every person with “performative male hobbies” is one. It’s not about the outside but rather the inside. In the case of the former, their outside is not in sync with their inside; they don’t own their image — it’s not them. So it creates this uncanny creature that is known as the performative male.</p><p>Now this is where I tell you that the title is misleading — I am not a performative male. I don’t know the word, but I’m sure the word is out there if you want to search for it.
The truth or perhaps my truth is that I have no interests or hobbies. Laying the truth about myself in plain text, just out there for everybody to see, feels like I am naked — and to be even more honest, it feels good. Now that everybody has seen your tiny dick, you don’t have to hide it anymore and can just live your life normally.</p><p>You’ve probably heard the question: “If a tree falls on the ground and there are no observers around, does it make a sound?” I don’t know the answer, but if I’m in my room and there are no people to observe me, then I have no interests. It’s all acting because I want to sound interesting and have interesting friends. I don’t watch movies because I connect to them emotionally or intellectually; I watch them because I like to throw and catch niche references. When I watch a movie, my brain turns off — there is no thought, no emotion, just an anticipation for the movie to end so I can add it to my Letterboxd. I know, evil right? I personally think my friends know this and can feel it but never say it. Maybe they believe in a better me, but I think they should stop believing.</p><p>I may say I am interested in this band, but if you ask me how many albums I know, I will say one. Asl me who the band members are, I will say I don’t know. Their gigs? silence is the awnser. I only listened to their album because I wanted to add them to a list — though this is not always true. I do feel a spark from time to time; to never feel a spark with any music is inhumane, and I think I am human at least to some degree. But I will never engage with the art more than that.</p><p>The same is true with other mediums and arts, and it’s not limited to art. My old hobby of computers and math is only to satisfy my artificially inflated ego that has nothing to deliver — actually, basically, I just want to sound smart.</p><p>I remember once crashing out when I was 13 because I was hit with the bitter truth for the first time, and I was pushing aside layers and layers of acting to find something authentic, something real — but all I found were more layers of me acting to be interested.</p><p>I am still human because my instinctive interests are intact. I love sex, good food, sleep — but take it up a notch, like poetry, and I lose interest and feel nothing. Oh, and I love myself.
I am self-obsessed. I never write about interesting stuff because I have no interests — so why would I write if I have nothing to say? I write because I love to talk about myself. My friends have definitely felt this one. Though I try to avoid it, it still shines through. I have tried to write about something other than myself, and I could not. I still can’t. Even in my life — I can’t, I can’t, I can’t. I am the most narcissistic, self-indulged person you can find in the market.</p><p>Okay, I don’t have a spark, an internal fire — so what? Where does it come from? I have always blamed it on my intelligence, but I think my memory also has a role to play in it too. The thing about me is that I remember nothing about my life. I can’t recall who I was two years ago. I don’t have a stable identity; even if I build one, I will forget it in a year. So this might be the reason, but I am not sure.</p><p>But maybe I still have a chance at redemption. I have strong feelings for certain people, and lately, I’ve started to feel flickers of genuine interest — small, subtle, almost imperceptible, but there. It’s not much, but it’s real enough to notice if I pay attention. And maybe that’s the start of something I can actually build on.</p><p>Thanks for putting your time into reading the least important, least interesting, least impactful essay of your life.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><div class=post-footer-data><div class=tags></div><hr><div class=date>Published: 2025-08-13</div><div class=updated>Updated: 2025-08-13</div></div></footer></article><footer><div class=social-links-footer><a href=mailto:myemail><div class=social-link>Email</div></a><a href=https://github.com/github%20id target=_blank><div class=social-link>GitHub</div></a><a href=https://gitlab.com/gitlab%20id target=_blank><div class=social-link>GitLab</div></a><a href=https://twitter.com/twitter%20id target=_blank><div class=social-link>Twitter</div></a><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/linkedin%20id target=_blank><div class=social-link>LinkedIn</div></a><a rel=me href=https://example.com/@username target=_blank><div class=social-link>Mastodon</div></a><div class=social-link></div></div><div class=copyright>Copyright (c) 2017, all rights reserved.</div><div class=poweredby>Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.</div></footer></div></body></html>

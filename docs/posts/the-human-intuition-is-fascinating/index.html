Intuition is actively in the background analyzing input either from the outside (our senses) or from the inside (our internal state) drawing conclusions and driving knowledge this knowledge can be temporary or permeant, and it can be accessed at any point by the consciousness it can also alter our emotions, most people associate intuition with anxiety or the feeling you get when something is wrong, but you are not quite sure what it is, but I associate all emotions with intuition and hormones. Intuition is responsible for the feeling of love, and it&rsquo;s the source of all mathematical proofs, jokes, poetry, music, movies and art, or at least it&rsquo;s the source of all the good ones. I am still not sure if intuition is general (i.e. being good in one field means that you can be good in other fields) or if it&rsquo;s specialized (i.e. based on your brain you can only be exceptional in one or multiple related fields) but I lean more towards it being specialized.</p><h3 id=can-i-improve-my-intuition>Can I improve my Intuition?</h3><p>The answer to the preceding question is yes, but there are limits that come down to your genetics, there is no doubt that some peoples intuitions are stronger than others and by spending the same amount of time as others on something will give them better results so yes you can improve it but to a point, and you may not get the same results by spending the same amount of time as someone else. My intuition is not great, and I know it, I face problems with tasks and challenges that pretty much come down to intuition yes it bothers me yes I don&rsquo;t know what to do.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><div class=post-footer-data><div class=tags></div><hr><div class=date>Published: 2024-11-18</div><div class=updated>Updated: 2024-11-18</div></div></footer></article><footer><div class=social-links-footer><a href=mailto:myemail><div class=social-link>Email</div></a><a href=https://github.com/github%20id target=_blank><div class=social-link>GitHub</div></a><a href=https://gitlab.com/gitlab%20id target=_blank><div class=social-link>GitLab</div></a><a href=https://twitter.com/twitter%20id target=_blank><div class=social-link>Twitter</div></a><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/linkedin%20id target=_blank><div class=social-link>LinkedIn</div></a><a rel=me href=https://example.com/@username target=_blank><div class=social-link>Mastodon</div></a><div class=social-link></div></div><div class=copyright>Copyright (c) 2017, all rights reserved.</div><div class=poweredby>Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.</div></footer></div></body></html>
